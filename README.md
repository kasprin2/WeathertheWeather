Weather the Weather

Thinkful (https://www.thinkful.com/) end of course portfolio-project. Applies a responsive app to check the 10-day weather forecast for a location.
   
Introduction

Weather the Weather allows you to check the 10-day weather forecast by entering in a zip-code. 

Use-Case

With just one piece of information – a zip-code – users will get an accurate, 10-day forecast for that location. This will enable them to prepare in advance for the type of weather they will encounter in the next 10 days. They will see what they temperatures will be and whether it will be sunny, cloudy, rainy, or snowy.

UX

Initial wireframes are below. The design was based around cards that would display the weather information for each day of the week. In desktop view these cards are listed horizontally, five to row.  On mobile view these cards are listed 1 per row completely vertical.
